I have two Java classes: one is an entity for example, and the other is a DTO.
Both classes have properties with the same names and compatible types.
Here is the class that does the job:

Java DTO class:
```Java
{{originalContent}}
```

Add to this Java class code that copies the value of the following field:
- Name: {{fieldName}} 
from the the first class to the second using the getter from the first clas and setter from the second.
Assume both classes are already defined. Use standard Java conventions.

Return:
1. The updated Java class.
