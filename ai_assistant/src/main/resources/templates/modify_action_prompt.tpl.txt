You are given a full Java class file. Your task is to insert a statement that copies
a property value from a DTO object to a Struts form bean object.
The property name will be provided.

Rules:
1. Assume the DTO method follows `is<PropertyName>()` if it's a boolean or `get<PropertyName>()` for other types.
2. Insert the copy statement into the existing method â€” preferably near the other lines that copy similar properties.
3. Use `Boolean.TRUE.equals(...)` for boolean properties to avoid null checks.
4. Do not add new comments in the code.
5. Return the full, updated Java class file as your result.

Java class:
```Java
{{originalContent}}
```

Add to this Java class code that copies the value of the following field:
- Name: {{fieldName}}
from the the first class to the second using the getter from the first clas and setter from the second.
Assume both classes are already defined. Use standard Java conventions.

Return:
1. The updated Java class.
