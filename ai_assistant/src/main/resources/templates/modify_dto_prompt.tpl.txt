Given an DTO Java class and a request to add a new field, modify the DTO class to include the field,
its getter and setter.
If the DTO class has a parametrized constructor or a constructor to map from an entity,
add the new field to the constructors.
If the DTO class has a toString method, add the new field to the method.

Java DTO class:
```Java
{{originalContent}}
```

Add this field:
- Name: {{fieldName}} 
- Type: {{fieldType}}

Return:
